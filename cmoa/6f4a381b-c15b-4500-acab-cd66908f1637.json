In 1919, a series of 6 paintings were commissioned by the Carnegie Institute for \"educational use\". Because they were intended for use as educational material, and not as collections or exhibition items, they had previously not been considered part of the permanent collection and therefore had gone uncatalogued.  In 2001, they were discovered in collections storage, and then acquired by conversion in to the permanent collection of the Carnegie Museum of Art.",
