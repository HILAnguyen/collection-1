  "provenance_text": "Dashwood family collection [1]; by descent to Major-General R. L. Dashwood [1837-1905] of Stanford Park, Notts, England and London, England, prabably in January 1891,but by summer 1900 [2]; Mrs. Charles (Annette Hershberg) Dreifus [1877-1961], Pittsburgh, PA, until April 10, 1961; by descent to her children, Charles Dreifus, Jr. [1908-1966] San Francisco, CA and Mrs. A. Cass  (Louise) Sunstein (1901-?), Pittsburgh, PA and Palm Beach, FL, until September 19, 1961 [3]; their gift to Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, September 1961.\n\nNotes:\n [1]. Probable descent in the Dashwood family: The sitter, Ann (Anne) Bateman Dashwood (see information on back of the painting), married on April 15, 1744 to Samuel Dashwood [1725-1793 or 1794]; their daughter Diana Dashwood [1748?-1812], married on July 8, 1765 to her cousin Charles Vere Dashwood [1745-?]; their son Samuel Francis Dashwood [1773-?], married Lydia Boughton Lister; their son Reverend Samuel Vere Dashwood [1803-1876], married (first) Caroline Hammond, on October 24, 1828; their son Charles Lewes Dashwood [1833-1891], who died unmarried; his brother Major General Richard Lewes Dashwood [1837-1905].\n[2]. The painting, as by Romney, was lent to \"Exhibition of a Special Selection from the Works by George Romney,\" The Grafton Galleries, Summer Exhibition 1900 by Maj.-General R. L. Dashwood. He was a great-great grandson of Ann Bateman Dashwood and younger brother of Charles Lewes Dashwood, who sold Stanford Hall in 1887 and died unmarried in January 1891.\n[3] The painting, as by Romney, apparently arrived at the museum as an intended gift in early 1961, when Mrs. Sunstein was \"dismantling\" her mother's house in Pittsburgh apparently before the latter's death in April 1961 (see curatorial file.)",
